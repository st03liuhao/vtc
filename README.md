# virtual_cabinet
A modern C++ library (C++20/23) for the virtualization of traffic controller cabinet in adherence with NEMA-TS1, NEMA-TS2, 170, Caltrans 232 and ATC Standards. 

The library provides software models of Field IOs, MMU/CMU, CU, BIU/CIU/SIU and SDLC serial bus, thus enables running tests of various cabinet devices in a flexible software-defined virtual environment. 

It can also be used as the basis to further develop Controller Interface Device (CID) for hardware-in-loop-simulation (HILS).

## Compiler
Requires a C++ compiler that supports C++20 and 23.

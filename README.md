# virtual_cabinet
A modern C++ library for virtualization of traffic controller cabinet in adherence with NEMA-TS2 and ATC Standards. The library provides software models of Field IOs, MMU/CMU, CU, BIU/SIU and SDLC serial bus, thus enables running tests of various cabinet devices inside flexible software-defined virtual environments. It can also be used as the basis to further develop Controller Interface Device (CID) for hardware-in-loop-simulation (HILS).
